# \[i.R.\] challenge

This challenge was to write a screen-scaper in node.js on the server side and a
simple page on the client side that accepts a search arg, calls the endpoint,
and displays the hits.

This challenge was time-limited to 90 minutes.

To run... in terminal:
```
$ node goog.js 3333
```
And then in the browser:
```
localhost:3333/form.html
```
